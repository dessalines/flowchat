[Referendum](https://referendum.ml) is a simple, open-source, discussion-based direct democracy platform.

It uses the best voting method available, [range voting](http://rangevoting.org) (also known as olympic score voting), for both comments and polls. Range voting beats out approval voting, IRV, and FPTP for [minimizing voter regret](http://rangevoting.org/UniqBest.html).

All polls are [dynamic polls](https://referendum.ml/poll/1#vote_tab), where users can contribute options or candidates themselves.

It features threaded discussion before voting, a key feature in collaborative systems.

Polls can be private, open to the public, or limited to users who have to pass captchas.

Check out a sample poll [here](https://referendum.ml/poll/1).
